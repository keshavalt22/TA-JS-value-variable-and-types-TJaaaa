/*
ðŸŽ– Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. With these conditions
 * [ ] You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of bank balance.
 * [ ] You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your spending threshold.
 * [ ] After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted like ($334.76).
 * [ ] Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.

const SPENDING_THRESHOLD = 200;
const TAX_RATE = 0.08;
const PHONE_PRICE = 99.99;
const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;

var bank_balance = 303.91;
var amount = 0;
var totalPhoneAmount=0;
var totalAccessoryAmount=0;
your code goes here
for(let i = 0 ; i < bank_balance; i = i + PHONE_PRICE) {
    // console.log(i)
    totalPhoneAmount = i;
    console.log(i)
}
 
for(let i = 0; i < SPENDING_THRESHOLD; i = i + ACCESSORY_PRICE) {
    totalAccessoryAmount = i;
    console.log(i)
}

let totalPurchase = totalPhoneAmount + totalAccessoryAmount;
console.log(totalPurchase)
// â›‘ Answer of the above will `$334.76`.
